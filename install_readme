# Install notes

There are many messy dependencies needed for this codebase to work.
For our purposes this is only showing how to install things to run the saved model (located in my_model_mnetv2)

The majority of the difficulty will be encountered in installing tensorflow and the object detection api

Following this guide should get you all straightened out:
https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#tensorflow-installation

In our case since we are just performing inference on images we can run this on cpu just fine. installing gpu drivers tends to get messy quickly

Once this guide is completed the code should run, provided you have installed opencv, glob etc.

Run opencv_webcam_mnet to test our tf. You likely will recieve gpu warnings (this is fine we are trying to use the cpu). It then should open up your webcam. hit the space bar to visualize the bounding boxes.
